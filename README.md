# Python-Library-Paho-MQTT-Chat-Application
Paho-MQTT is an open-source Python MQTT client developed by the Eclipse Foundation. Paho-MQTT can run on any device that supports Python. In this tutorial, we will build an MQTT client with Paho.  In this tutorial we look at the main client object, and itâ€™s methods.  We will then create a simple Chat Application which subscribes and publishes to topics.  We will use Public Broker mqtt.eclipse.org in our scripts.  Finally we will see the intuition behind Chat Bot Application.
